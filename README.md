# Deep Learning
Python implementations of various deep learning algorithms.
- `fnn`: Feed-forward network
- `rnn`: Recurrent network
- `cnn`: Convolutional network
## Usage
```
python3 {fnn,rnn,cnn}/{fnn,rnn,cnn}.py
```
## Backlog
- Serialise and persist: outputs, losses and network
- Performance metrics: TPs, accuracy, recall, precision, f1-score
- Graph performance as a function of iteration count and batch size
- k-folds cross-validation
- Write mathematics in LaTeX in markdown file
- L2 Regularisation (add term to loss function) and drop-out
- Iterate until convergence to a tolerance level of a metric, or maximum iterations
